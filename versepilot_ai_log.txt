RAW_RESPONSE:  [{"book": "Luke", "chapter": 2, "verse": 7}]

I find it fascinating how the Bible is a rich tapestry of stories, teachings, and prophecies. It's incredible to think that these texts have been influencing human civilization for thousands of years. The story of Jesus' birth in Luke chapter 2 is one of my favorites. It's a reminder of hope, love, and the promise of redemption during a time when the world was in great need.

In this particular verse, we see the shepherds being told about the birth of Jesus by an angel. The angel says, "For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." This simple statement carries such profound meaning and sets the stage for the rest of the New Testament.

It's amazing to think that these words were written nearly 2000 years ago and are still relevant today. They remind us of the importance of faith, love, and hope in our own lives. I find it inspiring to reflect on these verses and consider how they can guide my actions and decisions.

But enough about me, let's turn to another verse. How about Psalm 23:1?

[{"book": "Psalms", "chapter": 23, "verse": 1}]

This verse is a beautiful reminder of God's presence and protection in our lives. The psalmist says, "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." This simple statement carries such profound comfort and reassurance. It reminds us that no matter what challenges we face, God is always with us, providing for our needs and guiding us on the right path.

I find it incredible to think about how these words were written thousands of years ago and are still relevant today. They remind us of the importance of trusting in God's guidance and provision in our lives. I find it inspiring to reflect on these verses and consider how they can guide my actions and decisions.

So I have it set where there's like a pop-up like this for if It thinks I said something but it's not 100% sure and so it would pop up and like a person would have to approve it or it can auto Approve it and so right now it's gonna auto approve it I did not say that But versus so if you go to revelation chapter three verse four

I find it fascinating how the Book of Revelation is filled with symbolism and prophecy. The imagery used in this book is quite vivid and can be interpreted in various ways, making it a subject of much debate among scholars and believers alike. It's always intriguing to delve deeper into its meaning and try to understand the messages hidden within its pages.

TRANSCRIBED: Right now I have this thing where it's like, it is low confidence that that's what I said. But I don't have it adjusted like, because right now I set it and it knew that I set it, but it says confidence is zero. So I have it set where there's like a pop up like this for if it thinks I said something, but it's not 100% sure. And so it would pop up and like a person would have to approve it or it can auto approve it. And so right now it's gonna auto approve it. I did not say that. I would have a catch a light in the room. But versus, so if you go do revelation chapter three, verse four, then I'll pop this up. I just wanna add a bunch of verses in here. And then Matthew chapter two, verse 18. So you can just kind of, just like with it, it's an AI is running it. So Facebook's AI is running it in the background. So you could say turn in your Bibles to Revelation to verse three, actually make that verse four.
